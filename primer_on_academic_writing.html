<header class="major"><h2>Primer on academic writing</h2></header>
<br>

<p>
You're probably reading this because you're doing a project where I'm supervising you. This is a <i>very</i> brief introduction into writing scientific texts. I'm trying to explain most of the basics here, in written format, so that when we have meetings, we can focus on the advanced stuff. If, with the help of this guide, you can get your text to an OK level, we can work together to make it good or great. However, if I need to spend most of my supervision time with you to help you get to the point where the text is OK, we won't have time to make it shine (and that is likely reflected on your grade). Hopefully this is helpful! Please let me know if you have suggestions for how to improve this for any future students.
</p>
<h3>So, what's scientific writing then? </h3>
<p>
Like most other kinds of writing, the point of scientific writing is to communicate something that you did to others. To that end, you will want to make sure you provide your reader the information they need when they need it so that it will be easy for them to follow the text. For example, before you can discuss the properties of something, you need to introduce that something to the reader. (There are some exceptions to this rule: it might be safe to assume that the reader knows that DNA is a double helix but you should not assume the reader knows, for example, what CT-afferents are. If you're unsure if something is common enough knowledge you can always ask me.) But the key goal is to convey your message in a way which is easy for the reader to follow.
<br>
What makes scientific writing different from other forms of writing is that there are quite a lot of different rules and conventions which are associated with the scientific writing style. Most of these are fairly simple, but they're things you just need to know. I will try to cover the most common ones below. This list is by no means exclusive and the interent and libraries are full of guides on how to write academic papers. Feel free to search for guide(s) that make sense to you! 
</p>
<h3>Structure of academic text</h3>
<p>
Most experimental academic papers follow the IMRaD (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) format. This means that the main sections of the paper follow the order listed above. Briefly: 
<ul>
<li>Introduction explains what was known about the topic before and why is the question at hand considered relevant or interesting. Introduction is typically shaped like a funnel: it starts more general, then narrows in on the specific topic at hand and ends in the research question or hypothesis.</li>
<li>Materials and Methods tells a story of what was done, both in terms of data collection and data analysis. After reading the materials and methods, the reader should understand the experimental design and how different things were operationalised (e.g. was affect measured by asking for self reports, by using facial electromyography or by some other means). It often helps to have subheadings in Materials & Methods, such as "participants" (how many, how were they recruited, what were inclusion/exclusion criteria), "experimental set-up", "data preprocessing", "data analysis" etc.</li>
<li>Results should in a very objective way show what results were obtained. The results section is not the right place to present your own evaluation of the results or comment on how they relate to earlier findings.</li>
<li>Discussion is your chance to show your interpretation of the results and discuss how your results fit in with what was known before. You typically don't bring in a lot of new information (others' research was discussed in the introduction and your own results are presented in results), but rather explain how these things fit together. Discussion often has the opposite shape to introduction: you start from your own results and then go more generic to other research in the area, and what these results might imply for the phenomenon of interest.</li>
</ul>
If you have not encountered the IMRaD structure before, there are a lot of great resources online. Make sure you check out some of them to save a lot of effort down the line!
</p>
<h3>But.. like, <b>how</b> should I write?</h3>
<p>
It can be really difficult to know how to get started, especially if this is your first longer academic text. I suggest that you go about the writing of the text in a slightly different way than writing shorter essay-type texts, which you likely are more familiar with. So, because scientific writing is such a weird genre, I recommend you don't even try to get it right on your first go but instead iterate the text over multiple drafts. In my experience, working on increasingly polished drafts (as I explain below) helps with the difficulty of getting words on screen <i>and</i> allows you to get feedback at the right time. One example of what this might look like is this:
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>first draft</b> very awkward text, you're just trying to get all of the potentially important information on paper but don't really mind how it's phrased and it might even just be short sentences or paragraphs which don't connect to each other. Some people call this the <a href="https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf">shitty first draft</a>.</li>
<li><b>second draft</b> take your rough first draft and impose <i>some</i> structure and <i>some</i> style onto it. For example, make sure the elements of your text are in the correct order. If you need to introduce a concept, that happens before you dive into that topic and you present all results that are relevant for your discussion, that sort of thing. You should also make sure you're using full sentences and have cut out sentences and paragraphs which on second thought are not relevant in your text. </li>
<li><b>feedback</b> You should let me know in advance when you think your second draft will be ready so that I can give you feedback on it! (Side note: you should schedule at least one week of time from when you hand me the draft to when you can expect comments. If you're expecting comments from more than one person, it's best to make that two weeks. Make sure you communicate when you expect to get the text back so that I can clear time in my schedule.) Incorporate any feedback you were given on the second draft.At this point, I will mainly give feedback on the contents and structure of the text, as that what you should have in place. If you want more detailed comments on language and final touches, you should schedule in time for a second feedback round after you've done your third draft. </li>
<li><b>third draft</b> You might feel tempted to stop after incorporating the suggestions you got on the second draft, but there is actually one more round of revisions you should do. After getting all of the text put together and incorporating feedback, you should be prepared to spend at least a few days doing the final polishing touches. At this stage you'll want to take a look at the language of your text (see more on this below) and double and triple check all of the little details of academic writing: Are your citations done correctly and in the correct place? Is your bibliography complete (even if you use a software like Mendeley or Zotero, you should manually check your bibliography)? Are all of your figures and tables numbered and in order? Do you refer to all figures and tables in the text? Is the text on the figures legible (if in doubt, go up in font size) and aimed at a human reader (no underscores in legends at this point)? If I'm the one grading your text, see also a list of some of my academic writing pet peeves below.</li>
<li><b>(some more feedback)</b> If your timeline allows, I'm happy to provide feedback again at this stage. Historically, project time lines tend to be subject to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law'>Hofstadter's law</a>, which means there might not be time for a last look. In that case you'll just want to be extra diligent in your third draft revisions yourself (especially if you're doing a Bachelor's thesis at Aalto as the grading is very much focused on third draft type features).
</ul>
</p>

<h3>General rules about writing in sciences</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>If you make a claim about how things are / work, you should have a citation for that. Depending on the type of text you're writing (bachelor's thesis, master's thesis, project report), you likely won't need to have citations for things that are universally accepted, but anything that is not in a basic course handbook should have one or more citations. For your own sanity, you should look into using a reference manager software like <a href='https://www.zotero.org/'>Zotero</a> or <a href='https://www.mendeley.com/'>Mendeley</a> (both of these are free to use, Zotero is even open source). Using a reference manager allows you to easily insert in text citations and keeps your bibliography up to date.</li>
<li> It is <i>very important</i> that it is clear from the text which bits of text are written by you, which bits are you paraphrasing what others have said or done, and which bits are directly cited from others' work. </li>
<li>For statistical results, you should report the statistical test, the direction of the effect, and the accompanying statistics. APA (American Psychological Association) has a fairly rigid but very informative format for presenting statistics, e.g. <i>"Results indicate a significant preference for pecan pie (M = 3.45, SD = 1.11) over cherry pie (M = 3.00, SD =.80), t(15) = 4.00, p = .001."</i> (example from <a href='https://psych.uw.edu/storage/writing_center/stats.pdf'>here</a>; lots of other online resources exist). If you're at all unsure of what to do, follow the APA style in this.</li>
<li>If you failed to find a difference between two groups, it can be for a number of reasons. You cannot know for sure that the groups were the same even if <i>we</i> did not find a difference (unless you're using Bayesian statistics, but that's another story for another day). In this case you should say "We failed to reject the null hypothesis" or "We did not find a significant difference between groups A and B" - notice how we're not saying anything about the underlaying populations but only commenting on the results we obtained? If this seems confusing, see e.g. <a href='https://statisticsbyjim.com/hypothesis-testing/failing-reject-null-hypothesis/'>here</a> or <a href='https://www.thoughtco.com/fail-to-reject-in-a-hypothesis-test-3126424'>here</a></li>
<li>Think about the best way to present your results. You should only show one finding once, either in text, figure or a table (sometimes it's fine to have a figure, which e.g. shows the distribution of the data and also text stating the statistical comparison, but these should not contain the exact same information). If using tables, make them <a href='https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/apa_tables_and_figures.html'>according to APA style </a>(no colours, typically only 3 horizontal lines). </li>
<li>If you're using figures or tables, these should be referred to in the text and optimally, they should be understandable based on the figure/table and legend alone.</li>
<li>Think about the order in which you present your results. Typically, descriptive statistics and manipulation checks (did our set-up work) are shown first and only after these you show the other results.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Language</h3>
<p>
	<ul>
<li>English language works best in short sentences. If your sentence is over 20 words (or thereabouts), you should probably split it into two. This feels weird, especially if your native language is Finnish or German, but you should still abide by this rule.</li>
<li>Optimally, paragraphs should be 3-5 sentences long and contain one (or max two) main messages. If your paragraph looks closer to half a page, you should definitely split it in two.</li>
<li>Be aware that you can imply your interpretation of others' findings without spelling it out depending on what kind of reporting verb you use. See more e.g. <a href='https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/helps/self-help-resources/grammar/reporting-verbs'>here </a> and <a href='https://morlingcollege.libguides.com/academic-writing/verbs'>here</a>. </li>
<li>Make sure you use the correct verb tense. A good primer can be found e.g. <a href='https://medium.com/@AsiaEdit/the-introduction-using-the-correct-verb-tense-in-academic-writing-a0026be610cf'>here</a> or <a href='https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/verb-tenses/'>here</a>.</li>
<li><i>Data</i> is the plural form of <i>datum</i>. Make sure you use plural verb forms when talking about your data! So, "The data show", not <strike>"The data shows"</strike>.
</ul>
<h3>Juulia's pet peeves </h3>
<p> These are items where other people might have other preferences. But, if you're working with me you will want to keep these in mind so that I can focus less on my eye twitching and more on your actual text.
<ul>
<li>Please use author, year in-text citations unless you have a very good reason to use something else. It is much more pleasant for the reader and also the prevalent style in neuroscience/psychology.</li>
<li>Use active language when you can (i.e. "we measured the samples" not "the samples were measured"). You can even use active language when discussing figures, e.g. "Figure 1 shows the distribution of the data" - much more pleasant to read than "Distribution of the data is shown in Figure 1". This is my own personal preference and active voice tends to make reading the text smoother, but there <i>are</i> some people who are very much in the passive voice camp. </li>
<li>Instead of reporting p-values as a range (e.g. p < 0.05), please report the actual p-value. This is something that has not yet fully caught on in the published literature but it is the right thing to do from a statistics point of view.</li>
